# Intro to Front-end Web Development

## Useful Git Commands ##

- `git init` - places a directory on your computer to be under Git control
- `git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git` - sets a new remote
- `git add .` - adds all modified or untracked files
- `git commit -m "My commit message"`
- `git checkout -b branch_name` - creates a new branch on your local machine
- `git push -u origin <branch-name>` - pushes a new branch to your GitHub repository, creating the branch remotely
- `git push` - After the new branch has already been pushed remotely, use this command to push your local changes
- `git pull origin <branch-name>` - pulls and locally merges any remote changes into your current local branch

## CodePen Examples From Class ##
- [All Examples](http://codepen.io/collection/AWxeYG/)
- [Log All Input To Console](http://codepen.io/antibland/pen/bZjAYx?editors=1111) - We've got an HTML `input` and a JavaScript listener. We are logging everything the user types to the console. Recall that CodePen has a console of its own that you can open from the bottom of the interface. This means you don't need to open up the browser's inspector to see the result.

## Need Extra Help? ##

If you've got a burning question about something related to the class, feel free to email me [here](mailto:antibland@gmail.com?subject=Intro To Front-end Question). I'll do my best to get back to you quickly.

## What is this course all about?

Front-end development, of course. Whether you’re curious about what this profession is all about or have poked around and now seriously consider moving towards it as a career, I’m here to help get you started.

## Who are you?

I’ve worked professionally in front-end development for 17 years and work as a programmer at IBM. I’ve published a number of articles over the years dealing with responsive code and web accessibility. My career low point was working at a large bank; the high point was everything *but* that time.

## What can I expect to learn?

Over two weeks, you will be fed a delicious sampler platter of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, the key ingredients found in websites and web applications. In addition, you will learn about GIT and GitHub. GIT is the way most people handle code versioning on teams (or alone) and knowing it is essential if you are seeking employment in any coding field. GitHub is a place to store your code. GIT and GitHub are not made by the same persons, but fit together quite well. You will create a basic web page and push (a GIT term) it to a free GitHub repository. If time permits, you will be introduced to some development tools used to speed up and enhance the development process.

## Class structure

Each class will be split up with a lecture portion and number of individual and group exercises to reinforce the concepts you’re learning. Some of you will finish ahead of other students.

## Course Requirements and Grading

This course is neither letter-graded nor pass/fail. The assumption is that you’re here because you want to be. If you come out of the course feeling hungry for what’s next to come, it’s safe to say you took something valuable from our eighteen hours together. The only thing I ask is that you try to challenge yourself and (if possible) help others around you.

## Setup

Setting up your environment can be frustrating for first-time students. Don't be afraid to ask for help. We've all been through this before.

### Atom
Atom is a free piece of software we will use to write our code. [Download and Install Atom](https://atom.io/)

### Git
When writing code, we eventually need to keep different versions of it. Maybe we wrote something last week that worked well and we accidentally broke it. With tools like Git, we can return to the working version whenever we'd like.

Most coding jobs out there will require you know Git. The reason is that you'll be working around other people pushing similar to code to yours. What if three people push change the same file and upload to a server? Without versioning software like Git, the last upload will "win". Amazingly, this was once the way we worked. Today, things are much more sane because of software like Git.
