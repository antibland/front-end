# Intro to Front-end Web Development

## What is this course all about?

Front-end development, of course. Whether you’re curious about what this profession is all about or have poked around and now seriously consider moving towards it as a career, I’m here to help get you started.

## Who are you?

I’ve worked professionally in front-end development for 17 years and work as a programmer at IBM. I’ve published a number of articles over the years dealing with responsive code and web accessibility. My career low point was working at a large bank; the high point was everything *but* that time.

## What can I expect to learn?

Over two weeks, you will be fed a delicious sampler platter of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, the key ingredients found in websites and web applications. In addition, you will learn about GIT and GitHub. GIT is the way most people handle code versioning on teams (or alone) and knowing it is essential if you are seeking employment in any coding field. GitHub is a place to store your code. GIT and GitHub are not made by the same persons, but fit together quite well. You will create a basic web page and push (a GIT term) it to a free GitHub repository. If time permits, you will be introduced to some development tools used to speed up and enhance the development process.

## Class structure

Each class will be split up with a lecture portion and number of individual and group exercises to reinforce the concepts you’re learning. Some of you will finish ahead of other students.

## Course Requirements and Grading

This course is neither letter-graded nor pass/fail. The assumption is that you’re here because you want to be. If you come out of the course feeling hungry for what’s next to come, it’s safe to say you took something valuable from our eighteen hours together. The only thing I ask is that you try to challenge yourself and (if possible) help others around you.
