# Click Event Handlers

Create three boxes and make them respond to a user click. When clicking the first box, alert the user that the first box was clicked. Clicking the second box should alert the user that the second was clicked. Repeat for the third box.

## Extra Credit

When the user clicks on a box, *before the alert*, first prompt her for her name. If no name is provided, keep prompting until a name is provided. Once you've got a name, alert the user something like, "Thanks for clicking box 2, Janice".
