# Group Projects

## 1. Click Event Handlers

We have three boxes and need to make them respond to user clicks. When a user clicks a box, alert the user that the particular box was clicked. To access the text in the box, use `innerHTML`. For example, if the second box was clicked, the user should be alerted something like, "You clicked box 2".

**Extra Credit**

When the user clicks on a box, *before the alert*, first prompt her for her name. If no name is provided, keep prompting until a name is provided. Once you've got a name, alert the user something like, "Hi Janice. You clicked box 2".
