## Click Event Handlers

We have three boxes and need to make them respond to user clicks. When a user clicks a box, alert the user that the particular box was clicked. To access the text in the box, use `innerHTML`. For example, if the second box was clicked, the user should be alerted something like, "You clicked box 2".

**Extra Credit**

When the user clicks on a box, *before the alert*, first prompt her for her name. If no name is provided, keep prompting until a name is provided. Once you've got a name, alert the user something like, "Hi Janice. You clicked box 2".

## Run a Function Once

Users of our website are writing us to complain about a new popup feature we introduced. They're willing to see it once, but not every time they visit the website. Using `localStorage`, ensure that the `showPopup` function is only shown one time. Reloading the page should print nothing to the console.

**Removing a `localStorage` key from the console.** 

If you need to remove a previously set storage key, open up developer tools and click the 'Resources' tab. Open the 'LocalStorage' folder and delete the key you wish to remove.
